"Since we're dealing with the product of two binomial expressions, let's break it down step by step:\n"
            "1. Take the first item in the first bracket, including its sign, and multiply it by the entire second "
            "bracket.\n"
            "   For example, (a - 5)(a + 1): First, multiply +a by (a + 1).\n"
            "2. Then, take the second item in the first bracket, including the sign (-5), and multiply it by the "
            "second bracket.\n"
            "Watch out for sign mistakes! Some students forget to take the sign when multiplying, which leads to "
            "errors.\n"
            "   For instance, make sure you write -5(a + 1) rather than +5(a + 1).\n"
            "3. If the unknown variable is in the second item, such as (5 - a)(3 - a), ensure you consider the sign "
            "properly during multiplication."
